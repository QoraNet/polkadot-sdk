pub trait OnFinalizeBlockParts {
	/// Returns the fixed base cost of finalize_block operations.
	///
	/// This represents the constant overhead incurred during `on_finalize()` regardless
	/// of transaction count or event data. Includes setup costs, storage reads/writes,
	/// and other fixed operations.
	fn on_finalize_block_fixed() -> Weight;

	/// Returns the per-transaction weight cost for finalize_block operations.
	///
	/// This weight is applied incrementally during each `eth_call()` to:
	/// - Enforce gas limits before transaction execution
	/// - Reject transactions early if block capacity would be exceeded
	/// - Account for transaction-specific processing costs (RLP encoding, etc.)
	///
	/// # Parameters
	/// - `payload_size`: Size of the transaction payload in bytes
	fn on_finalize_block_per_tx(payload_size: u32) -> Weight;

	/// Returns the per-event weight cost for finalize_block operations.
	///
	/// This weight is applied dynamically during each `deposit_event()` to account for:
	/// - Event processing overhead (bloom filter updates, log conversion)
	/// - Data-dependent costs (RLP encoding scales with event data size)
	/// - Storage operations for event persistence
	///
	/// Uses differential cost calculation: `per_event_base + (data_len * per_byte_cost)`
	///
	/// # Parameters  
	/// - `data_len`: Total bytes of event data (includes topics and data field)
	fn on_finalize_block_per_event(data_len: u32) -> Weight;

/// Implementation of `OnFinalizeBlockParts` that derives high-level weights from `WeightInfo`
/// benchmarks.
///
/// **Weight Formula:**
/// ```text
/// Total weight = fixed_part + Σ(per_tx_part(payload_i)) + Σ(per_event_part(data_len_j))
/// ```
///
/// Uses differential calculation to isolate marginal costs from benchmark measurements.
